# Getting Started with Simple To-Do List

This project was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), and it utilizes Redux and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state management. The UI framework used is [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) (though it's not extensively used). Currently, there is no data storage implemented. In the future, functionality will be added to store data using local storage or a backend database.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
